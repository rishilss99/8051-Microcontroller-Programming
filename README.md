# 8051-Microcontroller-Programming

Programming in the sense of Microcontrollers (or any computer) means writing a sequence of instructions that are executed by the processor in a particular order to perform a predefined task. Programming also involves debugging and troubleshooting of instructions and instruction sequence to make sure that the desired task is performed.

Like any language, Programming Languages have certain words, grammar and rules. There are three types or levels of Programming Languages for 8051 Microcontroller. These levels are based on how closely the statements in the language resemble the operations or tasks performed by the Microcontroller.

The three levels of Programming Languages are:

1)Machine Language

2)Assembly Language

3)High-level Language

The code files contatin the codes for implementing numerical and boolean operations on the 8-bit 8051 microncontroller using Assembly language. Implemented using Keil Studio.
